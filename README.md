# Schedulo

A database-backed application for scheduling volunteers to coffee stops on a university campus. This is based on the volunteer-run coffee hubs that I remembered from when I was in university.

Built using Node.js, Express, Pug (templating), connect-loki, a Loki.js session store, and OO principles.
